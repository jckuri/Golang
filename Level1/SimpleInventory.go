/*
Simple Inventory
Statement
Create a Product struct with an attribute ID and Name, and an Inventory struct that will contain a map[string]Products. Create a method with a pointer of Inventory as a receiver and It will expect a product to be added into the map of products. 
Required: Add validations into the Add method, to check that the ID canâ€™t be empty and also not duplicated ID

Topics to Practice:
struct, composition, methods, pointer, error handling
